### CPSC 120
* Lab 4, Part-2
  It was one of my favorite labs, where we had to create high/low guessing games. I always wanted to create a game, and the challenge was to design a game where Player 1 chooses a secret number and Player 2 attempts to guess it. In the program, we used the if statement to give a hint to Player 2, which also helped determine the outcome of the game.

* Lab 7, Part-2
  This was my second favorite lab, and it was very challenging. My partner and I spent hours working on it. This program helps determine if the car can be parked depending on the parking restriction rules on signs. While working on this lab, I learned how to use operands and pointers as I had to navigate through different parking scenarios and determine whether parking was allowed.

* Lab 12, Part-1
  I think this was the coolest lab of all. At the beginning of the semester, the professor told us about how we were going to learn to make great GIFs by the end of the semester. I was unsure how we were going to get there, but when we started Lab 12, I realized how well-prepared we were to create. In this lab, we learned the practical application of library functions and the generation of random numbers in programming for color transitions.
